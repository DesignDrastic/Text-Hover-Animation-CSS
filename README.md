In this demo, you get a couple of text hover animation and effects. All the hover effects are simple, creative and smooth so you can use it on your websites, ex elements: Menu(link), A#href, Tags, Readmore, CTA, Categories, etc... 

And you can take those animations as an inspiration and you can create your custom animation/effects according to your need. 

In this post, we've used the hover transitions but you also can customize the code for click or on document.load animation.
